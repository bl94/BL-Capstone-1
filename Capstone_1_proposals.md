# **Capstone 1 proposals**

## **Proposal 1**
[NLSY97 dataset](https://www.nlsinfo.org/investigator/pages/search)

### **The NLSY97 dataset includes data about a range of important topics including people’s health, education, employment, criminal activity, and favorite flavor of ice cream.  If I cannot get data from the NLSY97 dataset I'll use the General Social Survey dataset instead.**

<br>

Questions to consider when creating visualizations: 

* Can the average amount of sleep someone gets per night be used to predict health issues?

* Which job search methods are most common?

* How does being a victim of crime affect people’s views about the role of government?

* Does spending 20+ hours a week in child care during the first year of life affect a person’s overall satisfaction with their life as an adult?

* Can the average amount of hours per week a person uses a computer be analyzed to predict their favorite flavor of ice cream?

## **Proposal 2**
[NYC Squirrel Census dataset](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2019/2019-10-29/nyc_squirrels.csv)

### **Some might argue that the NYC Squirrel Census of 2019 was likely a more successful census overall than the 2020 Census of people in the US.  Without a doubt there are some profound hidden secrets waiting to be discovered in this  dataset…**

<br>

Very important questions to consider when creating visualizations:

* What is a squirrel usually doing when someone first notices it?

* Which police precincts are squirrels most likely to be foraging in?

* Which city council districts inspire squirrels to tail twitch more?

* Which types of squirrels climb the most?

* Do squirrels vocalize more often in the AM hours or the PM hours?

* How often are squirrels climbing vs running?

* Which locations in New York City have the most squirrels making “quaa” sounds?

## **Proposal 3**
[IMDB dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/stefanoleone992/imdb-extensive-dataset) 

### **There’s a theory about the reciprocal relationship between media and society called the cone effect.  The theory suggests that a lot can be learned and predicted from analyzing what types of media (internet, television, movies, music, video games, etc.) people consume and how they engage with it.  A step toward understanding how media consumption can be used to predict behavior is to analyze what types of movies are most popular and why.  A way to begin lifting up a foot to take that step can be to use this dataset to explore what features are shared between the most watched movies.**
<br>


Questions to consider when creating visualizations:

* What types of plots are most engaging?  

* What types of plots are most popular?

* Can plot descriptions be used to predict when movies were released?

* Are some genres more popular during different months of the year?
